# challenge-1

Quick challenge, mostly deleting unnecessary css by grouping things together in classes, 
organizing the css and adding notes for easier navigation.
Getting rid of div vomit by adding sections, adding accessibility by adding alt elements on images.
Made sure all links are directing you to the correct place, and a general last code cleanup.
